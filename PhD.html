			<h3>Assessment of HRRR Model Forecasts of Convective
				Outflows in the Fire Environment</h3>
			<h3>Join Fire Science Program</h3>
			<h5>Status: Accepted</h5>
			<p>The proposed work will evaluate the ability of operational and experimental versions of the High
			Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) modeling system for the continental United State and Alaska to
			forecast the characteristics of mesoscale atmospheric boundaries arising from thunderstorm
			outflows, gust fronts, and downburst winds (referred collectively as convective outflows). The
			objective is to lead to enhanced situational awareness within the operational fire weather
			community of the ability of the HRRR model and predictive tools that rely on its output to nowcast
			and forecast convective outflows.

			<h3>Boundary Layer Sensitivity to Dynamically-Changing Surface States</h3>
			<h4>NASA's Earth and Space Science Fellowship program</h4>
			<h5>Status: Declined</h5>
			<p>High resolution numerical weather prediction models provide invaluable
			information for many applications, which include aviation, air quality,
			wildfire management, flooding hazards, solar and wind energy, and general
			weather forecasting. The accuracy of these numerical models are affected
			by their representation of the underlying surface state. Surface characteristics
			vary spatially and temporally on all scales due to anthropogenic and
			natural factors. For example, drought, irrigation, deforestation, wildfire
			burn scars, vegetation regrowth, urban development, and changes in coastlines
			and water covered areas affect albedo, surface roughness, soil moisture,
			and latent and sensible heat fluxes that alter atmospheric boundary layer
			processes.
			<p>Current operational weather prediction models tend to rely on static,
			outdated, and simplified land use classifications for the parameterization
			of heat, moisture, and momentum fluxes near the surface. Remote sensing
			estimates of surface state from a small sample of images are often used
			to develop those generalized land use classifications and their properties
			(e.g., albedo and surface roughness). More attention is now being placed
			on incorporating into research models remotely-sensed estimates of
			substantive local changes in the surface state that may have transpired
			on temporal scales within a few years to as recently as within the current season.
			<p>The objective of the proposed work is to investigate the sensitivity
			of numerical simulations of summertime atmospheric boundary layers in the
			western United States to improved characterization of the surface state
			derived from NASA remote sensing products. Of particular interest is to
			contrast the effects of early to late summer-season changes in: (1) areal
			extent and temperature of reservoirs and lakes and (2) extent and characteristics
			of vegetation and soil in rural and urban areas.Â  Reliance in numerical simulations
			on static or seasonally-evolving climatologies of surface state characteristics
			may introduce substantive errors in boundary-layer depths and transport winds
			that affect simulations of poor air quality episodes and wildfire outbreaks
			that are common during summer in the West. First, literature will be reviewed
			to identify appropriate specifications of surface characteristics, such as
			albedo and surface roughness, for more diverse ranges of land cover and
			vegetation than are commonly used for parameterizing surface fluxes in
			land surface models. Second, the extent to which those properties can be
			specified based on NASA remote-sensing products and utilized in the Weather
			Research and Forecast model will be assessed. Third, sensitivity of the
			atmospheric boundary layer to improved treatment of land use and cover
			will be investigated for selected case studies of high interest events
			(e.g., poor air quality episodes and after major wildfires). This work
			is intended to benefit the utility of high-resolution weather forecasts
			for diverse applications, including air quality, agriculture and water and forest management.

			<h3>Abstract</h3>
			<h5>Status: Declined</h5>
			<p>Residents of many coastal metropolitan areas are often exposed to unhealthy levels of ozone during summer. High ozone levels in
			coastal zones are common because offshore shallow stable boundary layers tend to decrease vertical mixing and concentrate ozone
			and precursor pollutants in a shallow layer near the surface. Thermally-driven flows between lakes or oceans and coastal urban and
			suburban areas subsequently may recirculate ozone and ozone precursors within the stable boundary-layer. Forecasting the evolution
			of coastal ozone events is a current challenge to air quality forecasters requiring high resolution numerical models. Preliminary work
			shows that these models are sensitive to the surface state, such as coastal water temperature and urban land cover properties.
			<p>Many operational weather and air quality models poorly initialize the underlying surface state in coastal areas, which can adversely
			affect the ability of numerical simulations to properly forecast boundary-layer depth and the timing and intensity of thermally-
			driven flows. In this proposed work, remote sensing estimates of the surface state will be used to improve simulations of the Weather
			Research and Forecast model. The sensitivity of coastal boundary layer characteristics to water surface temperature, green vegetation
			fraction, land use, urban properties, and albedo will be tested. The model simulations will be compared to observations from recent
			and upcoming ozone monitoring field studies. Upon completion, this proposed work will fulfill NASA's Science Mission Directorate
			to advance knowledge of our changing environment and improve life by using NASA remote sensing products to improve weather
			simulations and air quality forecasts in coastal environments.
